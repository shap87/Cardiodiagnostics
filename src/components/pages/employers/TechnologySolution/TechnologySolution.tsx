            The earlier that your employees understand their risk for heart
            disease, the sooner your employees will feel empowered to grow
            alongside the company. An estimated 80% of cardiovascular diseases,
            including coronary heart disease, are preventable with early action.
            Epi+Gen CHDâ„¢ is the heart health risk assessment test that
            prioritizes employees and their success while helping the company
            address the risk of lost productivity and retention.
